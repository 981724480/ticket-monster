What is TicketMonster?
======================
:Author: Marius Bogoevici

TicketMonster is an example application that focuses on Java EE6 - JSF 2, JPA 2, CDI and JAX-RS
along with HTML5, jQuery Mobile, JSF and GWT.  It is a moderately complex application that
demonstrates how to build modern web applications optimized for mobile & desktop. TicketMonster
is representative of an online ticketing broker - providing access to events (e.g. concerts,
shows, etc) with an online booking application.

Apart from being a demo, TicketMonster provides an already existing application structure that
you can use as a starting point for your app. You could try out your use cases, 
test your own ideas, or, contribute improvements back to the community.

The accompanying tutorials  walk you through the various tools & technologies needed to build TicketMonster on your own. Alternatively you can download TicketMonster as a completed application and import it into your favorite IDE.

Before we dive into the code, let's discuss the requirements for the application.

Use cases
~~~~~~~~~

We have grouped the current use cases in two major categories: end user oriented, and
administrative.

What can end users do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The end users of the application want to attend some cool events. They will try
to find shows, create bookings, or cancel bookings. The use cases are:

* look for current events;
* look for venues;
* select shows (events taking place at specific venues) and choose a performance time;
* book tickets;
* view current bookings;
* cancel bookings;

What can administrators do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Administrators are more concerned the operation of the business. They will manage the _master data_:
information about venues, events and shows, and will want to see how many tickets have been sold.
The use cases are:

* add, remove and update events;
* add, remove and update venues (including venue layouts);
* add, remove and update shows and performances;
* monitor ticket sales for current shows;

Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The application uses Java EE 6 services to provide business logic and persistence, utilizing
technologies such as CDI, EJB 3.1 and JAX-RS, JPA 2. These services back the user-facing booking
process, which is implemented using HTML5 and JavaScript, with support for mobile devices 
through jQuery Mobile.

The administration site is centered around CRUD use cases, so instead of
writing everything manually, the business layer and UI are generated by Forge,
using EJB 3.1, CDI and JSF. For a better user experience, Richfaces UI components are used.

Monitoring sales requires staying in touch with the latest changes on the server side, so this
part of the application will be developed in GWT and showcases Errai's support for real-time
updates via client-server CDI eventing.

The example is accompanied by a series of tutorials that will walk you through the process of
creating the TicketMonster application from end to end.

After reading this series you will understand how to:

* set up your project;
* define the persistence layer of the application;
* design and implement the business layer and expose it to the front-end via RESTful endpoints;
* implement a mobile-ready front-end using HTML 5, JSON, JavaScript and jQuery Mobile;
* develop a JSF-based administration interface rapidly using JSF and JBoss Forge;
* thoroughly test your project using JUnit and Arquillian;

Throughout the series, you will be shown how to achieve these goals using JBoss Developer Studio.
